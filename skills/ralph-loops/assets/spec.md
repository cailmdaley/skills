This is your spec for an autonomous iteration loop, a meditative iteration toward a desired state.

## Desired State

[Describe what you're building and why. Someone unfamiliar with the project should understand the goal from this section alone.

Be detailed about "done": the architecture, behavior, constraints, quality bar. You'll check reality against this and work to close the gap.

Use pointers, not snapshots. Say "check `grep -r 'pattern'`" not "50 files remain." Snapshots go stale; pointers stay valid.]

## Context

[Point to relevant files and existing patterns. When you see real implementations, you build coherently on them rather than introducing alien patterns.]

## Skills

[Skills to activate before working. Use `/skill-name`.]
